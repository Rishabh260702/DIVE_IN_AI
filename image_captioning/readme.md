i made this project during AI club inductions NITC where in i had to design a model which can predict captions of any image provided to it. using tensorflow and keras i did the job and the accuracy of my model was 78%
with this model building a learnt a lot about CNN's and about their main use in image processing and how to fine tune it for better results.
i attached my code for the project. do give it a read.
