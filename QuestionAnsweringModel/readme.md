I am currently working on this model. The main aim of this model is to predict answers in hindi and Tamil given a ocean of context and questions.
this model uses transformers and tokenizers from hugginface. i have also used datasets library from hugginface. 
apart from that basic imports like numpy, pandas, os is used. trainer lib is used for training and the scores is calc using jaaracd matrix. 
i am currently at a score of 0.63/1. trying to improve it.
